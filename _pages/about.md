I am a research scientist in the AI Security & Data Privacy Team at [IBM](https://research.ibm.com/labs/ireland/) in Ireland. I recevied my Ph.D. degree from the [Security, Privacy, and Data Science Laboratory](https://engineering.case.edu/research/labs/SPiD) in the [Department of Computer and Data Sciences](https://engineering.case.edu/computer-and-data-sciences) at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/) (CWRU), Cleveland, OH, in 2021, under the supervision of [Dr. Erman Ayday](https://engineering.case.edu/research/labs/SPiD/lab-members/erman). During my Ph.D. I did a research internship in the [Laboratory of Data Security](https://lds.epfl.ch/) at [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (EPFL), under the supervision of [Prof. Jean-Pierre Hubaux](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-pierre.hubaux). I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in [Computer Engineering](https://cen.epoka.edu.al/) from [Epoka University](https://epoka.edu.al/), Tirane, Albania, in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

My research interests include privacy-enhancing technologies (including big data and genomic privacy), and social network analysis. I enjoy studying problems at the intersection of big data analytics and security or privacy.
